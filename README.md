# OSC::VNC

TODO: Write a gem description

## Usage

First install the gems if you haven't already:

    $ bundle install --local

In your Gemfile on a websvcs node:

    gem 'osc-vnc'

## Binary

The binary was removed in a previous commit as it caused issues with
installing the gem locally through Bundler. This occurred in commit:
